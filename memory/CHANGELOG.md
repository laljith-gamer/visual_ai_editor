# CHANGELOG (project memory)

> A dated log of **notable changes** to the project and its memory. This is a
> lightweight, human-readable history — not a replacement for git history or
> the app's own product changelog (`/CHANGELOG.md` at the repo root).
>
> Newest entries at the **top**. Keep each entry concise.

### 2026-06-10 — Local chat/tool system merged to main; memory synced
- **Change made:** The capable local-first language layer landed on `main`:
  WebLLM engine + streaming chat + model-driven **tool router** (replaces the
  keyword/regex intent matching) + briefing "why" grounding, plus the
  deterministic `lib/vision-core` engine. Synced the memory files to reflect
  this (PROJECT_STATE status/module-table/next-step, TODO).
- **Files affected:** `lib/llm/*`, `lib/vision-core/*` (code, prior PRs);
  `memory/PROJECT_STATE.md`, `memory/TODO.md`, `memory/CHANGELOG.md` (this
  sync).
- **Reason:** Memory had gone stale — it still said the local-first modules
  were "on PRs / not on main." They are now merged (UI wiring still pending).
- **Still open (not on main):** PR #28 temporal-pass fix, #29 frame-tree,
  #30 captioning.

### 2026-06-08 — Add persistent project-memory system
- **Change made:** Created the `memory/` knowledge base (INDEX, PROJECT_STATE,
  DECISIONS, CONSTRAINTS, ROADMAP, TODO, CHANGELOG) and added an AI operating
  protocol to `AGENTS.md`.
- **Files affected:** `memory/*.md`, `AGENTS.md`.
- **Reason:** Let future AI sessions read repo context first and continue from
  the correct state. Documentation only — no application code changed.
