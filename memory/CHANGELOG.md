# CHANGELOG (project memory)

> A dated log of **notable changes** to the project and its memory. This is a
> lightweight, human-readable history — not a replacement for git history or
> the app's own product changelog (`/CHANGELOG.md` at the repo root).
>
> Newest entries at the **top**. Keep each entry concise.

### 2026-06-08 — Add persistent project-memory system
- **Change made:** Created the `memory/` knowledge base (INDEX, PROJECT_STATE,
  DECISIONS, CONSTRAINTS, ROADMAP, TODO, CHANGELOG) and added an AI operating
  protocol to `AGENTS.md`.
- **Files affected:** `memory/*.md`, `AGENTS.md`.
- **Reason:** Let future AI sessions read repo context first and continue from
  the correct state. Documentation only — no application code changed.
